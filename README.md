Mini Owner's Manual written in DITA

This is a documentation project based on a 1960s Mini Owner's Manual. The manual is written in DITA and can be output in a variety of formats.

Images are included in the project, and the source images are also available if you want to crop or resize them differently.

You can apply conditional output to the manual which covers the Saloon and Traveller models. The Traveller model was also sold as an Austin Countryman.

This project was written using Oxygen XML software.
